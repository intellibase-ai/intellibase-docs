<Warning>
  **This action is irreversible!** Deleting a project permanently removes:
  - All ingested data (nodes, edges, chunks)
  - All vector embeddings
  - All metadata and provenance
  - All ingestion jobs history
  
  Make sure you have backups if needed before deleting.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The project itself is deleted, but the **ontology** used by the project is preserved. You can reuse it for new projects.

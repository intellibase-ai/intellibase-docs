## What is Intellibase?

Intellibase is a modular **knowledge graph (KG) + vector database** context engine designed to give AI agents rich, long-term memory. It provides two powerful operating modes:

## Key Features

## How It Works

### 1. Define Your Ontology

Create a custom ontology that describes your domain's entities, relationships, and hierarchical structure.

<Info>
For vector-only projects, you can skip this step and go straight to ingestion.
</Info>

### 2. Create a Project

Projects can operate in two modes:
- **KG + Vector**: Requires an ontology; enables graph-based reasoning
- **Vector-Only**: No ontology needed; fast semantic search only

### 3. Ingest Data

Send text data to Intellibase. Depending on your project mode:
- **KG + Vector**: Extracts entities, builds relationships, creates hierarchies, and indexes chunks
- **Vector-Only**: Chunks text and creates vector embeddings

### 4. Query Your Data

Ask natural language questions. Intellibase automatically:
- Classifies the query type (KG, vector, or hybrid)
- Plans the optimal retrieval strategy
- Retrieves and ranks results
- Formats a comprehensive response

## Query Modes

Intellibase supports two query modes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static Mode">
    **Low-latency, deterministic retrieval**
    
    - Single-pass classification and retrieval
    - Predictable performance
    - Ideal for production applications
    - Default mode
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dynamic Mode">
    **Agentic, multi-step reasoning**
    
    - LLM-driven query planning and refinement
    - Adaptive retrieval strategies
    - Best for complex, exploratory queries
    - Higher latency but more intelligent
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Agent Memory">
    Give your AI agents persistent, queryable memory with temporal awareness. Track entities, relationships, and how they evolve over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Understanding">
    Build rich knowledge graphs from unstructured text. Extract entities, relationships, and hierarchical concepts automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Semantic Search">
    Fast vector-only mode for traditional RAG applications without the complexity of knowledge graphs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Research & Analysis">
    Track complex relationships between concepts, papers, authors, and findings with temporal validity.

## Architecture

Intellibase is built on a modular architecture with pluggable components:

- **Storage Layer**: Neo4j (graph), Qdrant (vectors), PostgreSQL (metadata)
- **Processing Layer**: LLM-based extraction, deduplication, hierarchy building
- **Query Layer**: Intelligent orchestration with mode-aware retrieval
- **API Layer**: RESTful FastAPI endpoints with OpenAPI documentation

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Node.js 19+ for local development

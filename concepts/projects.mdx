## What is a Project?

A **project** is an isolated workspace in Intellibase where you ingest data, build knowledge, and run queries. Each project has its own:

- Storage namespace (isolated data)
- Operating mode (KG+Vector or Vector-Only)
- Configuration settings
- Access controls

## Project Modes

Intellibase supports two distinct project modes, each optimized for different use cases:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vector-Only Mode">
    ### Vector-Only Mode
    
    **Simple, fast semantic search without knowledge graph construction**
    
    <Check>
      **Best for:**
      - Traditional RAG applications
      - Document search
      - Quick prototyping
      - When relationships between entities aren't important
    </Check>
    
    #### How It Works
    
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Raw Text] --> B[Chunk]
        B --> C[Embed]
        C --> D[Vector DB]
    ```
    
    1. **Chunk**: Text is split into semantic chunks
    2. **Embed**: Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
    3. **Store**: Embeddings are indexed in the vector database
    
    #### Features
    
    - ✅ Fast ingestion (no entity extraction)
    - ✅ Low latency queries
    - ✅ No ontology required
    - ✅ Simple to set up
    - ❌ No entity or relationship tracking
    - ❌ No hierarchical concepts
    - ❌ No temporal reasoning
    
    #### Example
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Document Search",
        "vector_only": true
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="KG + Vector Mode">
    ### KG + Vector Mode
    
    **Rich knowledge graphs with hierarchical reasoning and semantic search**
    
    <Check>
      **Best for:**
      - Complex domain modeling
      - Tracking entities and relationships
      - Temporal reasoning
      - Multi-hop queries
      - Hierarchical concepts
    </Check>
    
    #### How It Works
    
    ```mermaid
    graph TB
        A[Raw Text] --> B[Chunk]
        B --> C[Extract Entities]
        C --> D[Extract Relations]
        D --> E[Deduplicate]
        E --> F[Build Hierarchy]
        F --> G[Graph DB]
        B --> H[Embed]
        H --> I[Vector DB]
    ```
    
    1. **Chunk**: Text is split into semantic chunks
    2. **Extract**: LLM extracts entities and relationships
    3. **Deduplicate**: Merge duplicate entities
    4. **Hierarchy**: Build abstraction levels
    5. **Store**: Graph DB + Vector DB
    
    #### Features
    
    - ✅ Entity and relationship tracking
    - ✅ Hierarchical knowledge organization
    - ✅ Temporal validity (bitemporal)
    - ✅ Graph traversal queries
    - ✅ Hybrid retrieval (graph + vector)
    - ❌ Slower ingestion (LLM extraction)
    - ❌ Requires ontology design
    - ❌ Higher complexity
    
    #### Example
    
    ```bash
    # First create an ontology
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/ontologies \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Engineering Ontology",
        "version": "1.0",
        "schema": { ... }
      }'
    
    # Then create project with the ontology
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Engineering Knowledge Base",
        "ontology_id": "ont-123",
        "vector_only": false
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mode Comparison

| Feature | Vector-Only | KG + Vector |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Ontology Required** | No | Yes |
| **Ingestion Speed** | Fast | Slower (LLM extraction) |
| **Query Latency** | Low | Moderate |
| **Entity Tracking** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Relationships** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Temporal Reasoning** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Hierarchies** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Graph Traversal** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Semantic Search** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Use Case** | RAG, document search | Complex reasoning, agent memory |

## Project Configuration

When creating a project, you can customize various settings:

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "ontology_id": "ont-123",  // Optional for Vector-Only
  "vector_only": false
}
```

## Managing Projects

### Creating a Project

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/projects/create) for detailed information.

### Listing Projects

```bash
curl https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key"
```

Response includes mode and statistics:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj-123",
      "name": "My Project",
      "mode": "kg_vector",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "stats": {
        "total_nodes": 1234,
        "total_edges": 2345,
        "total_chunks": 456
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deleting a Project

<Warning>
  Deleting a project permanently removes all data including nodes, edges, vectors, and metadata. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key"
```

## Choosing the Right Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Requirements">
    Ask yourself:
    - Do I need to track entities and relationships?
    - Will I query about connections between entities?
    - Do I need temporal reasoning?
    - Is my domain hierarchical?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Complexity vs. Power">
    **Vector-Only** is simpler but less powerful. **KG+Vector** requires more setup but enables sophisticated reasoning.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Simple, Upgrade Later">
    If unsure, start with **Vector-Only** to validate your use case. You can always create a new KG+Vector project later with a custom ontology.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Migration Between Modes

Currently, projects cannot change modes after creation. To migrate:

1. Create a new project in the desired mode
2. Re-ingest your data into the new project
3. Update your application to use the new project ID
4. Delete the old project when ready

<Info>
  **Coming Soon**: We're working on project mode migration tools.

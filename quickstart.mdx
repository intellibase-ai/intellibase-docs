This guide will walk you through creating your first Intellibase project, ingesting data, and querying it.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

To use Intellibase, you need an API key:

1. Log in to the [Intellibase Dashboard](https://app.intellibase.dev)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your key (it starts with `ib-`)

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. It provides full access to your projects and data.

## Step 2: Create a new Project

Intellibase offers two project modes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="KG + Vector Mode">
    **Best for**: Capturing complex multi-hop relationships, hierarchal understanding, temporal reasoning and high accuracy.
    
    **Optionally define your custom ontology** - You can define a custom ontology for your knowledge graph (with help from AI) so that you get
    a highly dependable graph that captures all the information that is important to your agent without any unnecessary noise.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Custom/ Static Ontology">
          1. Use the [suggest ontology endpoint](/api-reference/ontologies/suggest) to get a suggested ontology by describing the use case or agent persona, optionally 
          sample expected input/ ouput that the agent will be expected to perform.

          ```bash
          # Let AI suggest an ontology based on your use case
          curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/ontologies/suggest \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "usecase": "Track software engineering projects, developers, and features"
            }'
          ```

          2. Use the [create ontology endpoint](/api-reference/ontologies/create) to save the ontology into Intellibase and generate an ontology ID.

          ```bash cURL
          curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/ontologies \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "name": "Software Engineering",
              "schema": {
                "ontology": {
                  "hierarchy": [
                    {
                      "level": 0,
                      "node_types": {
                        "Developer": {
                          "properties": ["name", "role", "team"],
                          "description": "Software developer"
                        },
                        "Feature": {
                          "properties": ["name", "status", "deadline"],
                          "description": "Software feature"
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  ],
                  "edge_types": [
                    {
                      "name": "WORKS_ON",
                      "source_types": ["Developer"],
                      "target_types": ["Feature"],
                      "properties": ["role"],
                      "temporal": true,
                      "description": "Developer works on feature"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              }
            }'
          ```
          
          3. Then create your project with the ontology ID you got from the previous step:
          
          ```bash
          curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "name": "Engineering Knowledge Base",
              "ontology_id": "ba879....",
            }'
          ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Dynamic Ontology">
          Create a project by providing a name. If you don't provide an ontology ID during project creation,
          the knowledge graph generated will not have a fixed/ static ontology and will be generated based on 
          the data being ingested into the engine.
          
          ```bash
          curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "name": "Engineering Knowledge Base",
              "ontology_id": "ba879....",
            }'
          ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vector-Only Mode">
    **Best for**: Traditional RAG, semantic search, getting started quickly
    
    **No ontology required** - just ingest and query!
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "My First Project",
        "vector_only": true
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Save the `project_id` from the response - you'll need it for all subsequent operations.
</Info>

## Step 3: Ingest data into your project

Now let's add some data to your project. We currently only support text input, we'll soon be adding support for more input data types.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Alice joined the engineering team in January 2024. She is working on the authentication feature, which is part of the security module. The feature is scheduled to launch in March 2024.",
    "source_doc_id": "doc-001",
  }'
```

The API returns a job ID:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job-abc123",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 4: Check Ingestion Status

Monitor your ingestion job:

```bash
curl https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job-abc123",
  "project_id": "proj-xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "chunks_processed": 3,
  "nodes_created": 5,
  "edges_created": 4,
  "started_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z"
}
```

<Check>
  When `status` is `completed`, your data is ready to query!
</Check>

## Step 5: Query Your Data

Ask natural language questions to fetch the most relevant nodes, edges and chunks.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static Mode (Fast)">

    The static query mode is designed for low latency and does not use AI during retrieval. 
    The results are still of very high quality and better than a basic vanilla vector RAG system.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/query \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "query": "What features is Alice working on?",
        "mode": "static"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dynamic Mode (Intelligent)">

    The dynamic query mode is designed for high accuracy with a slight trade-off in terms of latency. 
    It uses AI to retrive the most relevant information from the context engine.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.intellibase.dev/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/query \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ib-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "query": "What features is Alice working on?",
        "mode": "dynamic"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "What features is Alice working on?",
  "strategy_used": "hybrid",
  "results": {
    "summary": "Alice is working on the authentication feature, which is part of the security module and scheduled to launch in March 2024.",
    "entities": [
      {
        "type": "Person",
        "name": "Alice",
        "properties": {
          "role": "Engineer",
          "joined": "January 2024"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "Feature",
        "name": "Authentication Feature",
        "properties": {
          "module": "Security",
          "launch_date": "March 2024"
        }
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "source": "Alice",
        "target": "Authentication Feature",
        "type": "WORKS_ON"
      }
    ],
    "chunks": [
      {
        "text": "She is working on the authentication feature...",
        "similarity": 0.89
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
